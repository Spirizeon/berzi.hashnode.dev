So I was at my desk, reading this nice book on assembly while watching a casual Youtube video about some GOAT programmer coding an animation engine in C. And then i suddenly had this urge to write a non-technical blog i've hardly tried in years.

This blog is about my hopes and aspirations for my present and future self. I wish to share my unique perspective with the readers of this article. Let's kick the tires then.

DISCLAIMER: i'm not aiming to offend anybody with this, it's just my own thoughts on things.

## Adrenaline

There's a separate thrill to explore and a separate one to dig deep into a domain of CS engineering. I find enjoyment and satisfaction in researching about one particular discipline. Usually it's not the rave of the time, but it's something that most senior devs or researchers can relate to.

You get this fire blazing in your heart grow bigger the harder you grind the topic down to granular levels of theory, code, and discoveries. It's a passion that does not let you sleep at nights or spend your free time reading articles, watching YouTube projects and ideas, brainstorming and creating your own stuff.

## Embracing Machines

CS engineering at its heart is the machine, the computer. Low level languages like C, Rust measure the mettle of a real engineer. For they offer as little abstraction to the modern-world inventions as possible.

I'm not saying that this world is polluted by too many frameworks and high level implementations (somewhat true though), but the real joy lies in exploring what's under the hood.

Like how a watch artisan appreciates the movement (mechanical system) of a watch, they know what every single gear does. Scratch implementations of Core utilities, Operating systems, Web-servers is what demonstrates a crystal clear understanding and passion in the field.

## Trolls and memes

This domain should be fun, and not ruined by the formal restrictions of corporate life. Outside of that sphere, we need freedom. The sass to write stupid commit messages, write stuff that make life easier for us personally without caring about its impact for the rest of the world. Inject humor and memes in the code and comments. (Saying this because I love watching programming memes).

Getting down on the security standpoint is what we should also think about. Can this database be dropped? Can I spam this server with hundreds of requests? Hacking can feel amazing (unless you're doing it forcefully or it's your own project lol)

## Ecosystem

CS is a community that stays eternally thriving with the craziest ideas. Building insane things, sharing them with the world. And I love how it's that easy for anybody to get started in the field. I make sure Berzi's campfire also gets to be a part of this beautiful mesh of creativity.

But we have both the goods and bads. We have people who strive to innovate, engineer and invent. on the other side of the coin, we have lazy people who just want to get over with things, copy others code without embracing the theory. But that's what I find great too, it's what makes things colorful and not monotonous.
