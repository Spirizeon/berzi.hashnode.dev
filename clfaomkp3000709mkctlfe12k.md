My friend uses Opera as their daily driver due to it being lightweight and fast. However, I was a bit skeptical about the company's shady history.

So instead of switching to Opera directly, i considered downloading its core, Chromium.

Normally, Chromium has literally nothing, it's just Chrome without most of its features.

## Making it private

Privacy, the most major flaw in Opera's browser. Adding the extensions beneath helped it rise to stock Librewolf's level of privacy (maybe higher):

### 1\. User Agent Spoofer

### 2\. History and Cache cleaner

This was set to delete literally everything, including all cookies when closing the browser.

### 3\. Ublock Origin

Toggling advanced mode, Almost all of the adblock lists were enabled except regional ones.

Also, a secure DNS like OpenDNS was used instead of the default one.

It's true that Opera has a VPN feature but it isn't wise in the modern day and age to trust the proxy services of a company new to the VPN market.

## Making it secure

There's really no need to make it anymore secure, because that rivals Chrome and hence Brave.

## Making it aesthetic

It's still very lightweight because of not having any preconfigured "bloat" like other Chromium browsers (because it's Chromium itself!)

A custom homepage was added and configured through the Tabliss extension.

For webpages that lack or open in lightmode by default despite Chromium beign in dark mode, the Dark Reader extension came in handy.

The tabs bar looked a bit shabby which could easilybe beautified by the French Bulldog theme.
