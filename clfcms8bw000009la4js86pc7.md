For setup, you can follow the official [Documentation](https://fklc.github.io/WhatsAppToDiscord/) or follow the step by step guide bellow:

### Download your specific binary

You can download a copy from the [Official Releases](https://github.com/FKLC/WhatsAppToDiscord/releases) page

For Windows, look for the .exe file, For Linux-based and Mac OS choose those that've been named accordingly. Running it will pop a terminal window that will ask for a discord token.
