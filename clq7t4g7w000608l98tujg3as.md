### Intro to the series

Hi! Welcome to this new series of cybersecurity blogs called 'ZySec', In this series, we'll be exploring various concepts of cybersecurity, varying from operating systems, networking, cybersecurity fundamentals, Linux, programming, tools, etc. It's time we ignite our learning and understanding of the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of this eternal industry.

* Ransomware: Software that encrypts a user's files and demands a ransom (a sum of money) for the decryption key.
    
* Spyware: Software that quietly hides in the computer and records activity being done on it, and relays it to the threat actor.
    

#### Social engineering

Manipulation technique exploiting human error to gain access to data

Types:

* Social media phishing: Phising attacks through social media sites, like through tweets and DMs
    
* Watering hole attacks: attacking a website often visited by the target
    
* USB baiting: leaving out a malicious badUSB for anybody to use and install and infect their network
    
* Physical social engineering: Impersonation to gain unauthorised access to a physical location.
    

#### Social engineering principles

* Authority: positive and powerful influence over an individual makes them more vulnerable.
    
* Intimidation: Bullying, persuasion and other strategies.
    
* Scarcity: used in e-commerce mostly, to fake that goods/services are exhausting quickly
    
* Trust: Threat actors can form emotional bonds with targets to make them more vulnerable.
