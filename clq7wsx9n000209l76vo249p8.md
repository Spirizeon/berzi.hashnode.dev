In this article, we look over the 8 security domains or abstractions of cybersecurity posture provided by The Certified Information Systems Security Professionals (CISSP) certificate syllabus. And the various types of attacks that can be connected to these domains.

### 8 CISSP security domains

* Security Assessment and testing (Forensics and Testing)
    
* Security and Risk management
    
* Software development security
    
* Security engineering and architecture
    
* Communications and network security
    
* Identity and Access management (User privileges)
    
* Security Operations (Investigations, setting up tools)
    
* Asset security (protection of data)
    

#### Security and Risk management

* Assuring compliance
    
* Abiding my policies and procedures
    

#### Asset Security

* Data security measures
    
* Categorisation and possession of data
    

#### Security Architecture and Engineering

* Creation of security systems and frameworks
    
* Evaluating existing vulnerabilities in the old system
    

#### Communications and network security

* Focuses on network security
    
* Protects communication channels
    

#### Identity and Access Management

* Physical and cyber access to assets
    
* Identification and authentication of parties
    

#### Security Assessment and Testing

* Testing for vulnerabilities through **assessments** and **pentetration tests**
    
* Disaster recovery
    
* Awareness training for clients
    

#### Security Operations

* Investigation for vulnerabilities
    
* Logging and monitoring activities
    
* Managing physical security
    

#### Software Development Security

* Detect weakness and exploitable flaws in source code.
    
* evaluate existing problems with code.
    

### Types of Attacks

* Password attacks
    
* Social engineering attacks (like phishing)
    
* Physical attacks (malicious flash drive)
    
* Adversarial artificial intelligence (TRENDING)
    
    * Making use of artificial intelligence to perform attacks in a more sophisticated manner.
        
* Supply chain attacks
    
    * Infecting products with malware during the delivery process of devices when third parties are involved.
        
* Cryptographic attacks
    
    * Encryption cracking methods
        
    * Targets secure forms of communication
