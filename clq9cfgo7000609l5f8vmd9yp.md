This day deals with discussing foundational cybersecurity ethical models, certain defense principles and tools used by an entry-level cybersecurity analyst.

#### CIA model

CIA is used as a base model for most cybersecurity frameworks. It consists of three fundamental principles revolving around information confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA).

This helps establish proper security controls and reduce risks.

#### Refresher: Security frameworks

Security frameworks are sets of guidelines that helps an organization document security goals and achieve strong security goals ethically and lawfully.

#### International standpoint on counterattacks

The international court of justice has ruled out that if there a cyberattack, the affected party is only allowed to counterattack if:

* the counterattack only affects the attacker and nobody else.
    
* the counterattack is a direct signal for the attacker to stop
    
* the counterattack does not escalate the situation
    
* the counterattack's effects can be reversed.
    

#### Entry level analyst's toolkit

* SIEM (System Information and Event Management): Application that logs activity in the network and alerts the user incase of any suspicious activity found.
    
* IDS (Intrusion detection systems): Application that analyses real-time flow of data to detect unauthorized access in the network.
    
* Network protocol analysers (Packet sniffers): Applications that log network traffic for analysis.
    
* Playbook: A guide for any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident.
    
    * Chain of custody: process of documenting evidence possession and control methods
        
    * Protecting and preserving: process of preserving evidence for investigations
        
        * Order of volatility: Sequential preference in preservation given to the most volatile data.
