## Some Basic Terms and Objects

Active Directory is a central repository that centralises administration of components of windows machines within a Domain (or a network). Thereâ€™s something called Active Directory domain service, which holds info for all objects in network. Whatâ€™s an object? Users, Groups, Machines, the usual deal.

types of objects include security principals (can be authâ€™d by domain and can be assigned perms over resources), machines (saved as &lt;machine\_name&gt;$ )

security groups: groups of security principals (also considered as security principals!), hereâ€™s a priority-wise list of security groupsâ€¦

### Organisational units

Organisational units group users and machines with similar permission sets

1. builtin (default groups)
    
2. computers
    
3. DCs
    
4. user
    
5. managed service accounts (every resource requires a service account)

Security groups are to grant permissions together, while OUs are to group objects with similar permissions. By searching about GPOs on the Windows start menu, you can set policies for multiple groups.

## Trees, Forests, Subdomaining

trees is to create subdomains out of an existing domains, forest is a collection of trees. interconnected trees need to have a trust-policy (which can be either one-way or two-way trust)

<div data-node-type="callout-text">You might need a specification of at least 16GBs of RAM and at least 256 GBs of SSD storage, if not possible locally, consider a Cloud-based setup on Azure/AWS</div>
</div>

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need:

1. Windows server 2019
    
2. Least 2 Windows 10 enterprise edition
    
3. One Attackbox VM (like Kali/Parrot)
    

For Windows-based VMs, you can set aside 50-60GBs of disk space, and 25 GBs for the attackbox to enumerate and exploit your network. The server VM will act as the domain controller, while the enterprise VMs will act as client machines on the network. Please allocate at least 6 GBs of RAM to each and set the network type to NAT.
