A cybersecurity playbook is a guidebook that keeps getting updated with lessons learnt post-incident. It is a comprehensive roadmap on how to deal with attacks revolving around specific concepts like spyware, SQL injection, etc. However, they have specific rules as to how and on what grounds they are allowed to be updated which varies among firms.

#### Incident Response plan vs. Incident Response playbook

Incident response plans are summarized steps on how to deal with an incident, while playbooks are more elaborated guides that helps refine the solution to the specific security concern.

#### Phases of Incident response security playbooks

* Prepare: Make effort to create a good security posture to avoid an incident, create security playbooks, train personnel, exercise security-breach drills.
    
* Detection and analysis: Use SIEM (System Information and Event Management) , IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) tools to monitor metrics (Factors like response times, failure rates, etc), detect, and confirm breaches. Investigate the source of the breach.
    
* Containment: Take immediate measures to reduce further damage to organizational assets and take measures to neutralize the threat as much as possible.
    
* Eradication and Recovery: Restore damaged assets, document the incident and update the playbook.
    
* Collaboration: Let the concerned security team and higher authorities in the organization know about the incident.
    

Security playbooks are essential guides that are updated through incidents and security audits. They provide a structured pathway for a security analyst to respond to an incident.
