On this day, we elaborate on the various steps involved in NIST's(National Institute of Standards and Technology) RMF (Risk Management Framework) and CSF (Cybersecurity Framework).

These are the most popular security and risk-management frameworks that focuses on CIA as discussed in the earlier days. It is used to secure and monitor systems in organizations for potential threats.

In the modern day, we require at least one strong security and one risk-management framework for organisations.

#### All NIST-RMF steps boiled down

* Prepare
    
    * Identify the purpose of each kind of system
        
    * Identify the types of information and the extent of confidentiality required
        
* Select: Prepare security controls for when dealing with each kind of system
    
* Implement: Implement those security controls
    
* Analyse: Check how well the security controls implemented are working on securing the data
    
* Authorise: Continously report the implemented changes and their impact to the division's senior in the organization and request for their suggestions for improvements
    
* Monitor: Continuously monitor systems for pointing out any issues in compliance or security posture.
