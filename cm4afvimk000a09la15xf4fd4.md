Hello, world! üëã I‚Äôm Ayush Dutta, a developer with a passion for uncovering how things work beneath the surface. My journey in tech has been a thrilling ride across domains like Full Stack Development, DevOps, Linux, Networking, and, most importantly, **Reverse Engineering**.

## **Where It All Started**

My curiosity for breaking things apart (and putting them back together) led me to dive into reverse engineering. Understanding the inner workings of software and systems has always been my obsession, and it has fueled my projects and research.

While exploring the depths of low-level programming and system internals, I co-led **Google Developer Group (GDG)**, mentored students at **IIT Madras**, and contributed to cutting-edge projects with **WrenAI** and **NextTechLab**. I also had the privilege of interning as a researcher at **BITS Pilani**, which allowed me to explore innovative ideas in security and automation.

## **What I‚Äôm Working On**

Currently, my focus is on:

* **Product Security**: Strengthening systems from the ground up.
    
* **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing and dissecting binaries, networks, and firmware to improve system security.
    
* **Full Stack & DevOps**: Building scalable solutions that integrate seamlessly from development to deployment.
    
* **Linux & Networking**: Optimizing environments to maximize performance and security.

## **Why I Can't Stop the Hustle**

*‚ÄúOne day, the opportunities you have won‚Äôt be there anymore, and it might be too late for your loved ones to see you succeed by then.‚Äù* This belief drives me to keep learning, building, and sharing my knowledge.
